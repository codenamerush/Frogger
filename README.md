# Game of Bugs

### Installation
Simply download all the files and run the file index.html

### Rules
1. The player would by default be at the bottom center of the canvas while the enemies would run across the canvas in varying speeds.
2. The player can move left, right, up or down, in order to ao=void the bugs and reach the water.
3. Every time the player reaches the water successfully, he would've saved one character that would be displayed on the water grid row.
4. Losing any one round would reset the whole game.
5. The player must win a total of 5 rounds, without failing, to successfully win the game and **claim the bug throne**.

### Inspiration
The whole idea about rescuing characters, addition of kingdoms and the title "Game of Bugs", was inspired by the popular show, Game of Thrones.
